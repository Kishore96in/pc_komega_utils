# Introduction

Utilities to plot dispersion relations and fit modes in simulations that use the Pencil code (<https://github.com/pencil-code/pencil-code>).

- `power.cached` contains a replacement for `pc.read.power` that caches the results in a HDF5 file (allows faster reads and loading only a part of the array into memory)
- `power.decimate.make_decimated_power` allows to take the output of Pencil's `power_xy` subroutine and save only a subset of it into a HDF5 file. `power.decimate.m_pxy_decimated` is a mixin that allows the classes in `read` to use the decimated HDF5 output.
- `power.dat2h5` converts the text files used by Pencil's `power_xy` subroutine into HDF5 files.
	- `powerxy_to_hdf5`: converts `power*_xy.dat` to HDF5 files.
	- `read_power`: replacement for `pc.read.powers.Power` that uses the files generated by `powerxy_to_hdf5`

# Dependencies
1. numpy

# Known issues
1. Using `dill` to save dr_base instances is sometimes prevented by the following bug: <https://github.com/uqfoundation/dill/issues/332> (fixed in dill 0.3.8)
